## Get up and running in 15 minutes

Follow these five steps to install Respira for WordPress, generate an API key, set up the MCP server, and connect your AI assistant.

## 1. Install the Respira for WordPress plugin

Add the Respira for WordPress plugin to your site. This enables secure communication between WordPress and your AI assistant.

### Option A: Download from GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/webmyc/respira-wordpress/releases/latest)
2. Download `respira-for-wordpress-latest.zip`
3. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
4. Choose the ZIP file and click **Install Now**
5. Click **Activate Plugin**

### Option B: Manual installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file  
2. Extract it to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory  
3. Go to **Plugins** in WordPress Admin  
4. Find **Respira for WordPress** and click **Activate**

## 2. Generate an API key

Your API key identifies your AI assistant when it connects to WordPress.

1. Go to **Respira → API Keys** in WordPress Admin  
2. Click **Generate API Key**  
3. Give it a name such as `My Development Machine`  
4. Copy and save the API key — you will not be able to view it again

**Important:** Store your API key securely. You will need it when configuring the MCP server.

## 3. Download and install the MCP server

The MCP server runs locally on your machine. It creates the secure bridge between your AI coding assistant and your WordPress site.

### Option A: Install from npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

Or:

```bash
npx -y @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

### Option B: Download ZIP file

1. Go to your [Downloads page](https://respira.press/dashboard/downloads) (requires login)  
2. Download `respira-wordpress-mcp-server-latest.zip`  
3. Extract it to a folder such as `~/.respira/mcp-server/`  
4. Configure your MCP client to point to the `dist/index.js` file

**Recommended:** Use the npm installation for automatic updates and simpler management.

## 4. Configure your AI assistant

Connect Cursor, Claude Code, or another AI coding assistant so it can communicate with WordPress through Respira.

See the [Configuration Guide](/configuration) for detailed instructions for:

- [Cursor](/configuration#configure-cursor-ide)
- [Claude Code](/configuration#configure-claude-desktop-claude-code)
- [Codex](/configuration#configure-other-mcp-compatible-editors)

You will need your site URL and the API key you created in Step 2.

## 5. Start editing with AI

Once everything is configured, you can begin editing your WordPress site using natural language instructions.

Try commands such as:

- "List all pages on my WordPress site"  
- "Create a duplicate of the About page"  
- "Update the homepage title to 'Welcome'"  
- "Get the structure of my homepage and show me its sections"

Tip: Browse the [Prompts & Examples](/prompts) page for inspiration and effective phrasing.
