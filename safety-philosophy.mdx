## Why safety matters for AI and WordPress

Giving an AI tool write access to your WordPress site is a big trust decision. One bad edit can break layouts, tank SEO, or confuse customers.

Respira is designed so you never have to worry about AI accidentally destroying your work. The core idea: treat every AI change as an experiment in a sandbox, not as a live edit.

<Callout kind="info">
Respira never edits live content directly. Every change starts as a duplicate you control in wp-admin.
</Callout>

## Duplicate-before-edit: sandboxing your content

Respira’s primary safety mechanism is a strict duplicate-before-edit workflow. The AI never touches the published original.

### How the workflow behaves

Every AI write operation follows the same pattern:

- Respira duplicates the target page, post, or custom post first.
- The AI edits the duplicate, not the original.
- You review the duplicate in wp-admin using your normal editor.
- You decide what happens next.

Typical outcomes:

- **Approve and publish** the duplicate, replacing or supplementing the old content.
- **Reject and trash** the duplicate if you do not like the changes.
- **Manually tweak** the duplicate further before publishing.
- **Do nothing yet** and leave the duplicate as a draft for later.

Throughout this process, the original remains published and unchanged, so experiments never put your live site at risk.

### What you see in WordPress

From your perspective in wp-admin, Respira’s edits look like another human collaborator:

- New drafts labeled clearly as duplicates of existing content.
- Full editor support (Gutenberg, builders, classic editor) for reviewing and tweaking changes.
- Audit log entries showing what changed, when, and why.

If you know how to review drafts in WordPress, you already know how to review Respira’s work.

> 1. 'Duplicate-before-edit workflow' — stealing this immediately. I've used that pattern in other agentic tools but somehow didn't wire it into this one. Obvious in hindsight.
>
> 2. 'Sandboxing is the product' — perfect framing. In just a few days I went from fully trusting the AI to building structured, testable tooling the agent operates through instead. Delta-level mutations, progressive discovery via filtered element search, automated screenshot diffing against source — all to keep the agent from doing exactly the kind of damage this thread is about."

## How this compares to other safety strategies

Many teams already use safety strategies like staging sites, git-based rollbacks, or careful admin-side editing. Respira’s approach is different: it builds safety into each AI operation instead of relying on environment-level safeguards.

### Side-by-side comparison

| Strategy                    | Scope of changes                    | Risk to live site                     | Operational complexity            | Fits non-technical editors |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Staging site               | Whole site                          | Low (if staging is isolated)          | High (hosting, sync, merge)       | Medium                      |
| Git rollback               | Files, sometimes DB snapshots       | Medium (rolls back everything)        | High (CLI, deploy pipeline)       | Low                         |
| Direct admin-side editing  | Single page/post at a time          | High (edits are live)                 | Low (built into WordPress)        | High                        |
| Respira duplicate-first 🛡️ | Single page/post, per AI operation | Very low (original stays published)   | Low (review drafts in wp-admin)   | High                        |

### Why not rely on staging alone?

Staging sites are great for big redesigns, but they come with trade-offs:

- You need separate hosting and database copies.
- Keeping staging in sync with production is error-prone.
- Merging content changes back often means manual copy-paste.

Respira’s duplicate-first model gives you per-edit safety without a second environment. Each AI change is already sandboxed as a draft in production, so you get isolation without sync headaches.

### Why not rely on git rollback?

Git rollbacks shine for code-level disasters, not content experiments:

- Rolling back a deploy often rolls back _everything_, not just one mistaken edit.
- Database content is tricky to version-control and restore safely.
- Editors who live in WordPress rarely have CLI or git access.

Respira gives you localized, content-level rollbacks by design: delete or revert the duplicate and the original keeps serving traffic.

### Why direct AI editing in wp-admin is risky

Some AI tools log into WordPress and edit live content via the admin UI or REST API. This looks convenient, but:

- Mistakes ship immediately to visitors.
- Multi-step edits can leave content in a broken intermediate state.
- There is no clear “before and after” artifact tied to the AI change.

Respira never does this. Admin-side editing is reserved for you and your team; the AI only works on duplicates.

## Technical safety features

Under the hood, Respira layers multiple technical safeguards on top of the duplicate-first model. The goal is to fail safe whenever something looks wrong.

### Input validation and security checks

Before sending or applying changes, Respira validates both requests and content:

- **Security validation** against common issues such as XSS and SQL injection.
- **Schema and JSON validation** for structured payloads to catch malformed data early.
- **Content sanity checks** tuned for WordPress objects and builder content.

If validation fails at any point, Respira rejects the operation and leaves your content unchanged.

### Authentication and authorization

Only trusted AI tools and users should be able to request edits. Respira enforces:

- **API keys** that start with `respira_`, scoped to your WordPress site.
- **WordPress capabilities** checks so AI tools can only perform actions your user account is allowed to perform.
- **Nonces** and **rate limiting** to protect against replay attempts and abuse.

<Callout kind="alert">
Never share your Respira API key in public prompts or code examples. Treat it like a password tied to your WordPress admin access.
</Callout>

### Audit logging and retention

Every AI operation is tracked in an audit log, including:

- What was attempted (tool, target, and intent).
- When it happened.
- Who or what initiated it (including API keys).
- Why it ran (prompt or action context).
- Whether it succeeded, failed validation, or was cancelled.

Retention:

- **Starter license**: 30 days of audit history.
- **Agency license**: 90 days of audit history.

These logs give you a forensic trail if you ever need to investigate a change, review team usage, or tune your prompts.

### Graceful degradation and safe failure modes

Respira is designed to fail closed rather than silently corrupt data. When something goes wrong, it stops the operation instead of forcing through a half-broken result.

Common safe failure modes include:

- **Validation failure** → reject the change and keep the original untouched.
- **Timeouts or network issues** → cancel the operation, no partial writes.
- **Parser fallback** when content structures look unfamiliar, so odd edge cases do not break layouts.
- **Plugin conflict detection** that can automatically disable high-risk features if another plugin interferes.

You might see fewer successful AI edits in some edge cases, but your site stays safe.

### Permission controls and opt-ins

Respira starts with conservative defaults and requires explicit opt-in for riskier capabilities.

Typical patterns:

- Read-only analysis tools are enabled by default.
- Write tools and destructive operations require higher capabilities.
- Advanced features prompt you with clear warnings before you enable them.

You stay in control of what the AI is allowed to touch, on a capability and feature level.

## WooCommerce safety principles

The WooCommerce add-on extends the same safety philosophy to products, orders, and inventory. The goal is to let AI help manage your catalog without risking core business data or payment flows.

### How WooCommerce entities are protected

High-level behaviors:

- **Products** are duplicated before AI edits, including variations, so experiments never touch live product pages or pricing directly.
- **Orders** are tightly scoped: AI can only adjust safe fields such as shipping or billing addresses and order status. It never edits line items, totals, or payment details.
- **Status changes** still trigger the usual WooCommerce emails, so customers and staff remain in the loop.
- **Inventory** changes follow guarded flows with confirmations and a clear audit trail.
- **Payment gateways, shipping, and tax settings** remain read-only for the AI.

For deeper details and field-level behavior, see the dedicated WooCommerce safety guide.

## When things go wrong

Even with strong safeguards, mistakes and surprises can happen. Respira is designed to give you straightforward recovery paths.

### If an AI edit has not been published yet

If you or a teammate have not published the duplicate:

- **Trash the duplicate** draft or pending post/page.
- The original published content keeps serving visitors.
- The audit log still records what happened, in case you want to review it later.

This is the most common case when you are careful about approvals.

### If something was published by mistake

If a duplicate has already been published but you do not like the result:

- Use WordPress revisions or your usual content history tools to revert.
- Or manually switch back to the original content if you kept a copy.
- Cross-check the audit log to confirm which AI action caused which change.

Keeping the rollback flow consistent with normal WordPress editing reduces surprises for your team.

### If your subscription expired

If your Respira subscription lapses:

- Existing content and published pages continue to serve as usual.
- You have a **7-day grace period** where you can still access recent audit logs and recovery information.
- After the grace period, new AI operations will stop until you renew, but your live site does not break.

## Best practices for safe AI editing

You get the strongest guarantees when you combine Respira’s safeguards with a few simple habits.

### General editing practices

- **Review every duplicate** before publishing, especially on high-traffic or money pages.
- **Start with small scopes** (one page, one product) before attempting bulk updates.
- **Use clear prompts** that describe constraints (do not change URLs, keep headings, preserve shortcodes).
- **Check layouts** in your builder after major content changes, such as swapping long-form sections.

### WooCommerce-specific practices

- **Test on low-stakes products first**, such as drafts or internal SKUs.
- **Avoid price changes via AI** until you have validated prompt behavior and constraints.
- **Monitor order emails** when experimenting with AI-driven status updates, to confirm messaging looks right.
- **Keep inventory-sensitive changes manual** until you are fully comfortable with the workflows.

### Multi-site and team workflows

- **Scope API keys per site** instead of sharing one key across a whole network.
- **Use distinct keys per team or tool** to make audit logs easier to interpret.
- **Document your approval process** so everyone knows who reviews and publishes AI drafts.

If you want end-to-end patterns for multi-site and team setups, see the guides under [/guides/multi-site-management](/guides/multi-site-management) and [/guides/team-workflows](/guides/team-workflows).

## Support and human oversight

Technical support is part of the safety story. When something looks off, you should be able to talk to a human.

- **Starter license**: email support at `word@respira.press`.
- **Agency license**: priority email support on the same address.
- **WooCommerce add-on**: support included for all active subscriptions.

A human (Mihai) responds to all support requests, typically within about 24 hours, with a focus on real incident analysis, not scripted replies.

<Callout kind="tip">
If you suspect an AI edit caused an issue, mention approximate time, affected URL, and any prompt you used. Support can cross-reference audit logs much faster with these details.
