## What Respira is

- A safe, duplicate-first workflow for editing WordPress content with AI assistance
- A practical copilot for builders (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg) and site operations
- A place to standardize "do it safely or cry later" editing routines

## What Respira is not

- Not a magical auto-migrator that converts your whole site flawlessly
- Not a replacement for backups, staging, or basic operational hygiene
- Not a place to paste secrets, client data, or license keys (please do not)

## Where to get help

- Community support: GitHub Discussions (best effort)
- Bug reports: GitHub Issues (use the templates)
- Security issues: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)
