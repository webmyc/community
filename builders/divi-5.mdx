title: Divi 5 Support
description: Understand how Respira detects and safely edits Divi 5 block layouts and Divi 4 shortcodes, including limits, safety rules, and migration roles.
---

## Divi 5 support overview

Divi 5 changes how layouts are stored, and Respira is built to handle both the new block format and older shortcode layouts safely.

Respira helps you plan and validate your Divi 5 migration. Divi’s Migrator performs the actual conversion.

**What you’ll learn:**

1. How Respira detects Divi 5 vs Divi 4 pages and handles mixed content.
2. What Respira edits in Divi 5 block layouts and what it preserves.
3. How to keep existing Divi 4 workflows running while you migrate.

> Tip: Treat Divi 5 migration as a content and structure project, not only a plugin update. Plan, stage, and validate before you switch production pages.

## What Divi 5 support means in Respira

Divi 5 support in Respira focuses on safe reading and editing of both layout formats without changing how Divi itself works.

**Divi 5 layout format**

- Divi 5 uses a block-based layout format.
- Divi modules appear as `divi/*` blocks stored in `post_content`.
- The content structure is similar in spirit to WordPress core blocks but with Divi-specific block names and attributes.

**Divi 4 layout format**

- Divi 4 uses shortcode-based layouts.
- Layouts are stored as `et_pb_*` shortcodes inside `post_content`.
- Each shortcode encodes a module, row, or section with attributes.

**Respira behavior**

- Respira can read, edit, and save Divi 5 pages as blocks safely.
- Respira continues supporting Divi 4 pages by reading and writing the existing `et_pb_*` shortcodes.
- Respira does not perform automatic conversion between these formats.

## How Respira detects Divi 5 pages

Respira identifies the layout format by scanning the raw `post_content` for known Divi patterns instead of relying only on metadata.

### Detection rules

1. **Divi 5 pages (block-based)**  
   - Respira scans `post_content` for block markers where the block name starts with `divi/`.
   - If it finds one or more `divi/*` blocks and no `et_pb_` shortcodes, Respira treats the page as a Divi 5 layout.

2. **Divi 4 pages (shortcode-based)**  
   - Respira scans `post_content` for shortcodes where the tag name starts with `et_pb_`.
   - If it finds `et_pb_*` shortcodes and no `divi/*` blocks, Respira treats the page as a Divi 4 layout.

3. **Mixed pages (backward compatibility mode)**  
   - Divi 5 can load legacy Divi 4 modules via Backward Compatibility Mode.
   - On these pages, `post_content` can contain both:
     - `divi/*` blocks, and  
     - `et_pb_*` shortcodes for legacy modules.
   - Respira flags these as mixed-format pages so that editing is more conservative.

> Warning: Mixed pages running Backward Compatibility Mode can have performance and editing side effects. Plan to stabilize these layouts before doing large-scale edits.

### Quick checklist: how Respira classifies a page

- [x] Scan `post_content` for `divi/*` blocks.  
- [x] Scan `post_content` for `et_pb_*` shortcodes.  
- [x] If only blocks are present, treat as Divi 5.  
- [x] If only shortcodes are present, treat as Divi 4.  
- [x] If both are present, treat as mixed and apply stricter safety rules.

## What Respira edits in Divi 5 pages

On a Divi 5 page, Respira works directly with the block structure stored in `post_content`.

### Block structure handling

Respira:

1. Reads the full block tree for `divi/*` blocks.
2. Focuses changes on:
   - Text content within modules.
   - Selected attributes that are safe to adjust (for example, copy, headings, basic configuration).
3. Writes changes back while keeping the block order and hierarchy intact.

### Preservation rules

To avoid breaking layouts or custom behavior, Respira:

- Preserves unknown attributes on Divi 5 blocks.
- Avoids altering block types or turning Divi blocks into other block types.
- Does not strip or re-key attributes it does not recognize.
- Leaves custom JSON-like structures inside attributes untouched unless explicitly targeted for edit.

> Tip: If a block has complex styling or custom configuration attributes, edit only the specific text or fields you intend to change and leave structural attributes as they are.

### Safe edit checklist for Divi 5 blocks

- [x] Confirm the page is classified as Divi 5 or mixed in the Respira readiness report.  
- [x] Target clear, content-focused fields such as headings, body copy, buttons, and alt text.  
- [x] Avoid renaming block types or moving blocks across the layout in bulk edits.  
- [x] After changes, review the page live on staging to confirm layout and interactions still behave as expected.

## What remains compatible for Divi 4 pages

Your existing Divi 4 workflows continue to work in Respira.

### Shortcode handling

Respira:

- Reads `et_pb_*` shortcodes from `post_content` as structured modules.
- Edits module content and selected attributes while keeping shortcode tags and nesting intact.
- Writes updated shortcodes back without converting them into blocks.

### Existing workflows

You can continue to:

1. Run content and SEO updates on Divi 4 layouts.
2. Use Respira to refactor copy, headings, and basic module settings.
3. Keep using the same safety practices you already follow for Divi shortcode pages.

> Tip: Use your current Divi 4 workflows to clean up copy and structure before running Divi’s Migrator. Cleaner source layouts usually migrate more predictably.

## Limitations and safety rules

Divi 5 introduces Backward Compatibility Mode and mixed layouts, which require extra care. Respira leans toward safety over aggressive restructuring.

### General limitations

- Divi 5 can load legacy modules through Backward Compatibility Mode, which can affect performance and editing behavior.
- Respira does not disable or configure Backward Compatibility Mode. It only works with the content format it finds in `post_content`.
- Page-level performance issues from running both blocks and shortcodes come from the site configuration, not from Respira.

### Safety rules Respira follows

Respira treats certain parts of the layout as opaque unless you explicitly choose to edit them:

- Unknown attributes on Divi 5 blocks are preserved as-is.
- Legacy modules referenced via `et_pb_*` shortcodes remain in place.
- Complex layout constructs, such as nested containers or advanced cosmetic settings, are not restructured by default.

<Callout kind="alert">

For both Divi 4 and Divi 5 pages, Respira avoids wholesale reformatting. It works surgically on content and selected settings to keep layouts stable.

</Callout>

### Recommended operating procedure

Use this checklist to keep Divi 5 work safe:

1. **Work on staging first**

   - [x] Clone your production site to a staging environment.  
   - [x] Connect Respira to staging while you map and test your Divi 5 migration.  

2. **Audit your pages**

   - [x] Identify which pages are pure Divi 4, pure Divi 5, and mixed.  
   - [x] Prioritize high-traffic and template-based pages for extra review.  

3. **Limit edits on mixed pages**

   - [x] For pages with both `divi/*` blocks and `et_pb_*` shortcodes, avoid large structural changes.  
   - [x] Focus on text and minor attribute updates until you complete migration.  

4. **Validate before going live**

   - [x] After Respira edits, open each key page with Divi’s own editor.  
   - [x] Load the page on the front end to confirm layout, modules, and performance look correct.  
   - [x] Only then mirror changes to production.

## FAQ

<ExpandableGroup>

<Expandable title="Does Respira convert Divi 4 layouts to Divi 5?" default-open="true">

No. Divi’s Migrator performs conversion from Divi 4 shortcode layouts to Divi 5 blocks.

Respira helps you plan and validate your Divi 5 migration. Divi’s Migrator performs the actual conversion.

Use Respira to:

- Audit which pages are Divi 4, Divi 5, or mixed.
- Clean up content and structure on Divi 4 layouts before migration.
- Validate Divi 5 pages after they are converted.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I keep using Respira on sites that stay on Divi 4?">

Yes. Respira continues to support Divi 4 pages stored as `et_pb_*` shortcodes.

You can:

- Run ongoing content and SEO improvements on Divi 4 layouts.
- Keep your existing workflows without switching to blocks.
- Introduce Divi 5 on selected sites or sections when you are ready, then use Respira on both formats.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How does Backward Compatibility Mode affect Respira edits?">

When Divi 5 loads legacy modules via Backward Compatibility Mode, the page can contain both `divi/*` blocks and `et_pb_*` shortcodes.

Respira:

- Detects the mixed layout and treats it more conservatively.
- Edits content within each module format while preserving unknown attributes.
- Avoids reformatting or converting legacy shortcodes.

You should verify mixed pages carefully on staging for layout and performance before publishing changes to production.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What happens if Divi changes or adds new block attributes?">

Respira preserves attributes it does not explicitly know about.

Unknown or newly added attributes on `divi/*` blocks:

- Stay attached to their blocks when Respira edits content.
- Are not removed or renamed by Respira.
- Remain available for Divi’s own editor and runtime behavior.

If you start using new Divi features, consider testing a few pages first and confirming in your Respira readiness report that attributes are preserved as expected.
