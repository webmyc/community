# Divi (Divi 4 + Divi 5)

Technical documentation for using Respira with [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/).

## Divi 5 and migration support

Respira supports both Divi 4 and Divi 5 content structures so you can maintain existing layouts and prepare for migration.

- Divi 5 layouts are supported via their block-based `divi/*` structure
- Divi 4 layouts are supported via their shortcode-based `et_pb_*` structure
- Divi’s Migrator handles the actual conversion between Divi 4 and Divi 5 formats

Respira helps you plan and validate your Divi 5 migration. Divi’s Migrator performs the actual conversion.

Use these resources for Divi 5 specific workflows:

- [Divi 5 builder reference](/builders/divi-5)
- [Divi 5 Migration Copilot toolkit](/toolkits/divi-5-migration-copilot)
- [Divi 4 to Divi 5 migration guide](/guides/divi-4-to-divi-5)
- [Divi 5 troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/divi-5)

## What you will learn

- How Divi 4 shortcode-based layouts map to Respira’s module model
- How Divi 5 block-based layouts differ from Divi 4 and what stays the same
- How to identify, query, and update Divi modules safely with Respira

## About Divi

[Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) by Elegant Themes is one of the most popular WordPress page builders with over 2 million active installations. It features a visual drag-and-drop editor with 200+ content modules.

## Data structure

Divi 4 stores its builder layouts as `et_pb_*` shortcodes in `post_content`. Divi 5 uses block-based layouts where Divi modules appear as `divi/*` blocks in `post_content`. Respira works against both formats but does not perform the migration or conversion between them.

Divi stores content as shortcodes in `post_content`:

```text
[et_pb_section fb_built="1" _builder_version="4.16"]
  [et_pb_row]
    [et_pb_column type="4_4"]
      [et_pb_text admin_label="Hero Text"]
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
      [/et_pb_text]
      [et_pb_button admin_label="CTA" button_text="Get Started" button_url="/contact"]
      [/et_pb_button]
    [/et_pb_column]
  [/et_pb_row]
[/et_pb_section]
```

## Module identification

### By admin label (recommended)

Set in Divi: Module Settings → Advanced → Admin Label

```json
{ "admin_label": "Hero CTA Button" }
```

### By path

```json
{ "path": "sections[0].rows[0].columns[0].modules[1]" }
```

### By type

```json
{ "type": "et_pb_button", "match_content": "Get Started" }
```

## Common Divi modules

| Module | Shortcode | Key Attributes |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Text | et_pb_text | content (HTML) |
| Button | et_pb_button | button_text, button_url |
| Image | et_pb_image | src, alt, url |
| Blurb | et_pb_blurb | title, content, image |
| Code | et_pb_code | content (raw HTML/JS) |
| Accordion | et_pb_accordion | nested et_pb_accordion_item |
| Tabs | et_pb_tabs | nested et_pb_tab |
| Slider | et_pb_slider | nested et_pb_slide |
| CTA | et_pb_cta | title, button_text, button_url |
| Contact Form | et_pb_contact_form | email, title |

## Example prompts for Divi

**Content updates:**

- "Change the hero headline to 'Welcome Home'"
- "Update all button colors to #FF5733"
- "Replace the about section image"

**Structure queries:**

- "Show me all sections on this page"
- "List all buttons and their text"
- "What modules are in the first row?"

**Bulk updates:**

- "Find all buttons with 'Learn More' and change to 'Get Started'"
- "Update the copyright year in the footer to 2025"

## Global modules

Respira detects Divi Global Modules. Updates to global modules appear everywhere they are used.

- "List all global modules" → Shows global module library
- "Update the global footer email address" → Changes it site-wide

## Limitations

- Visual-only settings (hover states) may need Divi builder
- Per-module custom CSS is supported but complex styling may need builder
- Dynamic content tokens are preserved but not directly editable
