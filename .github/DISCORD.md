# Discord

The **Respira for WordPress GitHub Community** has both GitHub Discussions and Discord. Here's when to use what.

## Use GitHub Discussions for:

✅ Bug reports (searchable, permanent)
✅ Feature requests (trackable, votable)
✅ Documentation questions (findable later via search)
✅ Troubleshooting (helps future people with same issue)
✅ Prompt recipes (needs to be catalogued)

**Why:** GitHub is public, searchable, indexed. Future you (or future someone) can find the answer.

## Use Discord for:

✅ Quick questions ("does this work with X?")
✅ Real-time help ("I'm stuck right now")
✅ Community chat (hanging out, sharing wins)
✅ Voice/screenshare debugging
✅ Off-topic / water cooler conversation

**Why:** Discord is fast, casual, synchronous. Good for vibes, bad for documentation.

## The Rule

**If the answer should be discoverable in 6 months → GitHub.**
**If it's transient conversation → Discord.**

When someone asks a good question in Discord and gets a good answer:
→ Post it in GitHub Discussions so it's searchable.
