title: Divi 5 Migration Prompt Pack
description: Use five structured prompts to plan, validate, and clean up your Divi 5 migration, from readiness and backups to QA and modernizing layouts.
---

## Overview

Respira helps you plan and validate your Divi 5 migration. Divi’s Migrator performs the actual conversion.

Use this prompt pack to turn your Divi 5 migration into a repeatable workflow instead of a one-off scramble.

**What you’ll learn**

- How to assess whether a site is ready for Divi 5 before you touch production
- How to design a safe staging, backup, and rollback path for each migration
- How to validate migrated pages, clean up Compatibility Mode, and modernize layouts

<Callout kind="info">

These prompts are for planning, validation, and cleanup. Divi’s own Migrator handles the underlying Divi 4 → Divi 5 conversion.

</Callout>

## How to use these prompts

Use the prompt pack with any AI assistant, and optionally inside Respira when your workflow supports it.

<Steps>

<Step title="Copy the prompt you need" icon="copy">

- Scroll to the relevant prompt section below.
- Select all the text inside the prompt’s code block.
- Copy it to your clipboard.

</Step>

<Step title="Paste into your AI workflow" icon="terminal">

- Open your preferred AI assistant (or your Respira workspace if it supports custom prompts).
- Paste the prompt verbatim.
- When the prompt asks for site-specific details, provide them as clearly as you can.

</Step>

<Step title="Optionally run inside Respira" icon="zap">

- If you use Respira with Divi-aware tools, run these prompts inside Respira so it can:
  - Inspect your WordPress and Divi configuration.
  - Read sample pages and layouts before recommending changes.
- When your current setup does not support running prompts directly in Respira, run them in your AI assistant and then apply the recommendations with Respira’s tools.

</Step>

<Step title="Apply and iterate" icon="check-circle">

- Follow the checklist or plan produced by each prompt.
- Mark items complete as you go and re-run prompts when:
  - You change your staging or backup strategy.
  - You finish a batch of migrations and want updated QA coverage.
  - You modernize more layouts out of Compatibility Mode.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Prompt pack contents

This pack includes five prompts, designed to run in sequence or on their own:

1. **Migration Readiness Audit**
2. **Staging + Backup Plan**
3. **Compatibility Mode Cleanup Plan**
4. **Post-migration QA Checklist**
5. **Modernize This Layout** (post-migration refactor to native Divi 5 modules)

Respira helps you plan and validate your Divi 5 migration. Divi’s Migrator performs the actual conversion.

---

## 1. Migration Readiness Audit

Use this prompt before you touch production to understand what could break, which sites to prioritize, and what to document.

### Purpose

Identify technical and process risks before running Divi’s Migrator so you can:

- Spot incompatible plugins, custom code, and fragile layouts.
- Prioritize sites or sections with higher risk.
- Decide where you need extra QA or stakeholder sign-off.

### Inputs needed

Have these details ready when you run the prompt:

- Site context:
  - WordPress version and PHP version.
  - Current Divi version and whether Divi 5 is already installed.
  - Hosting type (shared, managed, VPS) and caching stack.
- Divi usage:
  - Number and types of layouts (pages, templates, theme builder layouts).
  - Use of global modules, theme builder, and dynamic content.
  - Use of Divi’s legacy or third-party modules.
- Customizations:
  - Child theme in use and what it changes (functions, templates, CSS).
  - Custom PHP snippets or mu-plugins touching Divi output.
  - Custom JavaScript, CSS frameworks, or animation libraries.
- Business constraints:
  - Allowed maintenance window(s).
  - Performance, SEO, or accessibility requirements that must not regress.

### Output you should expect

The assistant should return:

- A concise **risk summary** for migrating this site to Divi 5.
- A **categorized list of risks**, such as:
  - Theme and child theme conflicts.
  - Plugin conflicts (especially builder add-ons).
  - Custom code risks.
  - Layout/UX risks.
- A **recommended migration order** for sections or sites.
- A short **stakeholder briefing** you can paste into an email or ticket.

### Suggested next action

- Share the risk summary with your team or client.
- Open your project tracker and:
  - Add tasks for each medium/high risk finding.
  - Link those tasks to staging and QA work.
- Then run the **Staging + Backup Plan** prompt for the same site.

### Prompt: Migration Readiness Audit

```text
You are a senior WordPress technical lead and Divi specialist.

- Why we are migrating to Divi 5 now
- The main risks you identified (in plain language)
- How we will reduce those risks (staging, backups, QA)
- What stakeholders should expect during the migration window.
```

---

## 2. Staging + Backup Plan

Use this prompt to define a clear, repeatable safety net before you run Divi’s Migrator.

### Purpose

Design a concrete plan for staging, backups, and rollback so you can:

- Avoid performing risky migrations directly on production.
- Know exactly how to recover if something goes wrong.
- Standardize migration safety across client sites.

### Inputs needed

Prepare the following details:

- Current backup setup:
  - Backup plugin or hosting backups in use.
  - Frequency and retention (how often, how long kept).
  - Whether you have tested a restore recently.
- Staging setup:
  - Whether you already have a staging or development copy.
  - How staging is created and updated (clone, push/pull tools, manual).
  - Any differences between staging and production (domains, caching, CDN).
- Access and roles:
  - Who has admin access to WordPress, hosting, and DNS.
  - Who will run Divi’s Migrator and who will approve changes.
- Change window:
  - Preferred day/time for migration.
  - Blackout periods where changes are not allowed.

### Output you should expect

The assistant should return:

- A **staging strategy** (new environment, reusing existing, or local-first).
- A **backup and rollback plan** with:
  - Pre-migration snapshot steps.
  - Clear restore instructions.
- A **checklist** you can run through before starting each migration.
- A brief **runbook** you can reuse across sites.

### Suggested next action

- Create or verify the staging environment described.
- Run a **test restore** on staging using a recent backup.
- Once staging and backups are in place, run the **Compatibility Mode Cleanup Plan** prompt.

### Prompt: Staging + Backup Plan

```text
You are a senior WordPress DevOps engineer and Divi specialist.

I am preparing to migrate a site from Divi 4 to Divi 5 using Divi’s Migrator. I need a concrete, low-drama staging and backup plan that a small team or agency can actually follow.

1) BACKUP SETUP
- Current backup plugin(s) in use:
- Hosting-level backups available (yes/no, details):
- Backup frequency and retention:
- Date of last successful restore test and how it was tested:

2) STAGING / ENVIRONMENTS
- Do we have an existing staging site? If yes, how is it kept in sync with production?
- Is there a local development copy? If yes, how up to date is it?
- Any differences between staging and production (domains, caching, CDN, object cache, PHP settings, etc.):

3) ACCESS & ROLES
- Who can:
  - Trigger backups:
  - Restore backups:
  - Create or refresh staging:
  - Run Divi’s Migrator:
  - Approve changes (client, PM, etc.):

4) CHANGE WINDOW
- Preferred migration window (day/time and timezone):
- Any blackout periods where changes are not allowed:
- Expected traffic levels during the migration window (low/medium/high):

Using this information, produce:

A. STAGING STRATEGY
- Recommend whether to:
  - Create a new staging site, or
  - Reuse and refresh an existing staging site, or
  - Work locally first, then stage.
- Explain why this strategy fits the inputs above.
- Give a numbered checklist for setting up/refreshing staging before the migration.

B. BACKUP & ROLLBACK PLAN
- Describe exactly which backups to take and when, in relation to the migration (database + files).
- Provide a clear, step-by-step rollback plan that:
  - Restores the site to its pre-migration state.
  - Includes sanity checks after restore (front-end, forms, key funnels).
- Call out any gaps or risks in the current backup setup.

C. MIGRATION RUNBOOK
Create a concise, reusable runbook with:
- Pre-migration checklist (what to verify the day before and hour before).
- During-migration steps (what to do in staging and production).
- Post-migration checklist (what to verify before calling the migration complete).

D. TEAM COMMUNICATION NOTES
Write a short note I can share with the team that covers:
- Where we will run Divi’s Migrator (staging vs production).
- How we will back up and how to roll back.
- Who is on point during the migration window.
- What to do and who to contact if unexpected issues appear.
```

## 3. Compatibility Mode Cleanup Plan

Use this prompt after you have a migrated copy (usually in staging) that still relies on Compatibility Mode.

### Purpose

Plan how to reduce or eliminate Compatibility Mode dependencies in a controlled way so you can:

- Understand which layouts and modules still depend on legacy behavior.
- Decide what to refactor now versus later.
- Avoid breaking fragile pages when turning off Compatibility Mode.

### Inputs needed

Have this ready when you run the prompt:

- Current Compatibility Mode status:
  - Whether Compatibility Mode is enabled globally.
  - Any per-page overrides in use.
- Inventory of migrated layouts:
  - Examples of pages where Compatibility Mode is clearly required.
  - Examples of pages that likely do not need it.
  - Known problem areas (animations, custom JS, third-party modules).
- Constraints:
  - Time budget for cleanup per site.
  - Appetite for visually changing layouts versus keeping them pixel-perfect.
  - Any dependencies on legacy CSS or JS.

### Output you should expect

The assistant should return:

- A **classification** of layouts/modules into:
  - Safe to run without Compatibility Mode.
  - Needs partial refactor before turning it off.
  - Should remain in Compatibility Mode for now.
- A **phased cleanup plan** (per section or per page type).
- A **checklist** for testing pages when toggling Compatibility Mode.

### Suggested next action

- Apply the phased plan in staging.
- Use the checklist to verify key pages after each change.
- When a page is stable without Compatibility Mode, mark it for further modernization with **Modernize This Layout**.

### Prompt: Compatibility Mode Cleanup Plan

```text
You are a senior Divi implementer experienced with Divi 5 and Compatibility Mode trade-offs.

I have a site that has been migrated to Divi 5 using Divi’s Migrator. Many layouts still rely on Compatibility Mode. I want a practical plan to reduce that dependency without breaking important pages.

1) COMPATIBILITY MODE STATUS
- Is Compatibility Mode currently enabled globally?
- Are there any per-page overrides or exceptions?
- Any attempts so far to disable or restrict Compatibility Mode? What happened?

2) LAYOUT INVENTORY
Describe, at a high level:
- Types of layouts in use (landing pages, blog posts, shop pages, archives, etc.).
- Examples of layouts that clearly break when Compatibility Mode is disabled (what breaks?).
- Examples of layouts that still look fine without Compatibility Mode.
- Any third-party Divi modules or add-ons that seem to depend on legacy behavior.

3) CUSTOM CODE & INTEGRATIONS
- Custom CSS that targets Divi-specific classes or markup:
- JavaScript that relies on specific Divi DOM structure or events:
- Any integrations (forms, tracking scripts, A/B testing) that may rely on legacy markup:

4) CONSTRAINTS
- Time available for cleanup per site (e.g. 2 hours, 1 day, multiple days):
- How strictly do layouts need to match existing designs (pixel-perfect vs “close enough”):
- Any pages or flows that are business-critical and must be handled with extra care:

Using this information, produce:

A. CLEANUP STRATEGY OVERVIEW
- Explain the recommended approach to reducing Compatibility Mode usage for this site.
- Call out which categories of pages should stay in Compatibility Mode for now, and which are candidates for early cleanup.

B. CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK
Provide a simple framework I can use to classify pages into:
- “Safe without Compatibility Mode”
- “Needs partial refactor”
- “Leave in Compatibility Mode for now”
For each category, describe:
- Typical symptoms
- How to test quickly
- Recommended action

C. PHASED CLEANUP PLAN
Propose a phased plan with concrete steps:
- Phase 1: Quick wins and low-risk pages.
- Phase 2: Medium complexity pages.
- Phase 3: High-risk or business-critical flows.
For each phase, include:
- Entry criteria (which pages to tackle).
- A numbered checklist for what to do on each page.
- Exit criteria (how I know the phase is complete).

D. TESTING CHECKLIST
Create a repeatable checklist I can use when toggling Compatibility Mode for a page or group of pages, covering:
- Visual layout checks
- Functional checks (forms, navigation, CTAs)
- Responsive checks (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Performance and Core Web Vitals considerations (at a high level).

E. COMMUNICATION NOTES
Write a short note I can share with stakeholders that:
- Explains what Compatibility Mode is in plain language.
- Describes why we are trying to reduce reliance on it.
- Sets expectations about which pages may change slightly and why.
```

- Site priorities:
  - Most important conversion paths (lead forms, checkout, bookings).
  - High-traffic pages that must be visually correct.
- Technical details:
  - Use of custom post types with Divi layouts.
  - Any custom header/footer or theme builder templates.
  - Third-party integrations (forms, payments, tracking, A/B testing).
- Known fragile areas:
  - Pages with heavy animations or motion effects.
  - Complex grids, overlapping elements, or creative layouts.
  - Known previous migration or update issues.

### Output you should expect

The assistant should return:

- A **prioritized QA checklist** grouped by:
  - Business-critical flows.
  - High-traffic or brand-critical pages.
  - Templates and global elements.
  - Technical checks (forms, scripts, performance sanity).
- Clear **pass/fail criteria** for each group.
- A short **QA summary template** you can fill in after testing.

### Suggested next action

- Assign checklist sections to team members or clients.
- Run the QA pass in staging before touching production.
- Feed back any failures into your migration and cleanup plan.

### Prompt: Post-migration QA Checklist

```text
You are a senior QA lead for WordPress and Divi-based sites.

I have migrated a site from Divi 4 to Divi 5 using Divi’s Migrator. I need a focused, high-value QA checklist tailored to this site so we catch critical issues before we push to production.

1) SITE PRIORITIES
- List the primary conversion paths (e.g. lead forms, checkout, bookings, contact forms):
- List the top 10–20 pages by importance (home, key landing pages, pricing, product pages, etc.):
- Any pages that are especially brand-sensitive (must look perfect):

2) TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Custom post types that use Divi layouts:
- Use of Divi Theme Builder (headers, footers, templates, archives):
- Third-party integrations (forms, CRMs, payments, booking tools, marketing scripts, A/B testing tools):

Using this information, produce:

A. PRIORITIZED QA CHECKLIST
Organize checks into these sections:
- Business-critical flows
- High-traffic and brand-critical pages
- Templates and global elements (headers, footers, theme builder templates)
- Forms, integrations, and tracking
- Performance and UX sanity checks

For each section:
- Provide a numbered checklist of specific things to verify.
- Include clear pass/fail criteria where possible.

B. QUICK SMOKE TEST
Design a very short (10–15 minute) smoke test I can run immediately after migration to catch show-stopper issues fast.

C. DETAILED PASS TEMPLATE
Provide a simple template I can copy into a ticket or doc to record:
- What was tested
- Who tested
- Date/time
- Findings and severity
- Go/no-go recommendation

D. CLIENT/STAKHOLDER SUMMARY
Write a short, non-technical paragraph summarizing:
- What we checked after the Divi 5 migration
- Whether we saw any major issues
- What will happen next (fixes, sign-off, deployment).
```
