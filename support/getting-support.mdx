## Start with self‑help

Check common fixes and known issues before you write in. Many problems resolve faster this way.

- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting)
- [Configuration](/configuration)
- [FAQ](/support/faq)

If those do not solve it, try the community or email support.

## Community (free, best-effort)

<Callout kind="info">

All Respira licenses include technical support. Starter and Agency licenses, and the WooCommerce add‑on subscription, all come with help from Mihai, not a support bot.

</Callout>

## What is included with your license

Use the same email address for all plans: [word@respira.press](mailto:word@respira.press).

- **Starter license**  
  Standard email support at [word@respira.press](mailto:word@respira.press).

- **Agency license**  
  Priority email support at [word@respira.press](mailto:word@respira.press). These requests are handled first.

- **WooCommerce add‑on**  
  Technical support is included with your WooCommerce add‑on as long as your €7/month subscription is active.

Response time is typically within 24 hours for all licenses, with Agency requests handled first when there is a queue.

## Who you are talking to

Support emails go directly to Mihai, the Respira founder.

You always get a human response, not an automated support bot.

## How to contact support

Email: [word@respira.press](mailto:word@respira.press)

You can write in about:

- Installation or update issues
- Configuration problems or unexpected behavior
- Errors when running audits or tools
- Billing or license questions related to Respira or the WooCommerce add‑on

## What to include in your message

Include these details so Mihai can understand and fix the problem quickly:

- **WordPress version** you are running (for example, 6.4.x)
- **Respira plugin version** and, if relevant, WooCommerce add‑on version
- **What you were trying to do** when the issue appeared  
  Short description of the action or workflow.
- **Exact error messages** you saw  
  Copy and paste the text or attach screenshots.
- **Your site URL** and whether it is staging or production
- **Recent changes** just before the issue started  
  For example: new plugins, theme changes, hosting changes, or major updates.

Providing this checklist in your first email usually means fewer follow‑up questions and a faster resolution.
