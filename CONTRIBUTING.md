# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Respira for WordPress docs and community resources.

## What you can contribute

- Docs fixes (typos, clarity, missing steps)
- Troubleshooting notes
- Prompt recipes (safe, reusable patterns)
- Small improvements to issue templates

## What you cannot contribute here

This repo does not include the commercial plugin source code, so PRs that touch the private plugin cannot be accepted here.

## How to contribute

1) Fork the repo
2) Create a branch: feat/your-change or fix/your-change
3) Make your change
4) Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if relevant

## Writing style

- Short paragraphs
- Bullets over walls of text
- Prefer checklists and concrete steps
- Avoid marketing language
- If you reference commands, include the full command

## Docs edits

If the docs framework supports "Edit this page", use it.
Otherwise, edit the markdown file directly and open a PR.
