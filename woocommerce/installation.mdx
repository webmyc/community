## Overview

Connect Respira to WooCommerce by installing the WooCommerce add-on plugin, activating your license, and confirming that your AI assistant can access WooCommerce MCP tools.

<Callout kind="info">

Before you start, confirm that:

- Respira Core is installed and configured on your WordPress site. If not, follow the [Installation](/installation) guide first.
- The official WooCommerce plugin is installed, active, and connected to your store on the same site.

</Callout>

## Requirements

The WooCommerce integration works only when all of the following are true:

- **Respira Core plugin is active** on your WordPress site.
- **WooCommerce plugin is active** and your store is set up.
- **WooCommerce add-on subscription is active** (trial or paid).
- You have access to your **LemonSqueezy license key** for the add-on.

Support for the WooCommerce add-on is included with your subscription. Email **word@respira.press** for help.

## Install the WooCommerce add-on

Use these steps to subscribe, install, and activate the WooCommerce integration.

<Steps>

<Step title="Subscribe to the WooCommerce add-on" icon="download">

Start your subscription so you can access updates and support for the WooCommerce integration.

- Go to your Respira account area.
- Navigate to **Account → Billing → Add-ons**.
- Find the **WooCommerce** add-on.
- Start a **7-day free trial** or subscribe for **€7/month**.

Your subscription should now appear as active in the add-ons list.

</Step>

<Step title="Download the WooCommerce add-on plugin" icon="download">

Download the latest version of the WooCommerce add-on as a ZIP file.

- Open the WooCommerce add-on repository at  
  `https://github.com/respira-press/respira-woocommerce-addon`.
- Download the plugin from the **Releases** section or from `/releases` if linked from your account.

You should now have a ZIP file for the WooCommerce add-on on your computer.

<Step title="Install and activate the plugin in WordPress" icon="package">

Add the WooCommerce add-on to your WordPress site like any other plugin.

- In WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New**.

<Step title="Activate your WooCommerce license" icon="key">

Connect your subscription license so updates and MCP tools work correctly.

- In WordPress admin, go to **Respira → WooCommerce**.
- Find the license section.
- Enter the **license key from LemonSqueezy** associated with your WooCommerce add-on subscription.
- Click **Activate License**.

If activation succeeds, the license status should change to active on this screen.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify WooCommerce tools are available" icon="check-circle">

Confirm that the MCP server detects WooCommerce and exposes the full set of tools.

<Callout kind="info">

Use this quick prompt in your AI assistant that is connected to Respira:

> What WooCommerce tools are available?

A successful setup returns a list of **20+ WooCommerce tools**. If you see fewer tools or an error, check the Troubleshooting section below.

If WooCommerce tools do not appear or the license does not activate:

- Review the [Troubleshooting](/woocommerce/troubleshooting) guide for WooCommerce-specific fixes.
- Confirm that both **Respira Core** and **WooCommerce** plugins are active.
- Double-check your LemonSqueezy license key and subscription status.
