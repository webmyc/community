## How WooCommerce tools work with your AI assistant

WooCommerce tools let your AI assistant read and modify store data in a structured, auditable way. Each tool encapsulates a specific WooCommerce action such as listing products, updating orders, or checking stock.

Your AI assistant typically decides which tool to call based on natural language prompts. You do not need to remember every tool name, but knowing the main ones helps when you:

- Design repeatable workflows and automations
- Set guardrails for what the assistant is allowed to change
- Review logs and audit which tools were used

When the WooCommerce add-on is installed, the assistant has access to 20+ WooCommerce tools. This page highlights the primary tools in four categories: products, orders, inventory, and reports.

<Callout kind="info">

Use this reference to understand capabilities and naming. For exact parameter and response shapes, inspect the tool calls in your AI assistant or logs.

</Callout>

## Using the tool list in workflows

When you write prompts or design workflows, you can:

- Refer to tools by name if you want to constrain behavior.
- Describe outcomes in natural language and let the assistant choose tools.
- Combine WooCommerce tools with existing WordPress tools for end-to-end flows.

For example:

- "List the 50 best-selling products from last month and draft improved descriptions."
- "Duplicate the current homepage hero product and set it as out of stock."
- "Find all orders with failed payments this week and summarize issues."

The sections below group tools by area and summarize what each one does and how you might use it in workflows.

## Product tools

Product tools manage WooCommerce products and their variations. Use them to browse, inspect, create, and update catalog items.

<Callout kind="tip">

Product tools often work together. A common pattern is list → get → duplicate → update, which keeps edits safe and traceable.

</Callout>

### woocommerce_list_products

List products that match basic filters such as status or search keywords.

<ParamField body="filters" param-type="object" show-location="false">

Optional filter object such as status, category, or search text. Exact shape may vary between environments; check the tool output in your AI assistant.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pagination" param-type="object" show-location="false">

Optional pagination controls such as page and per_page. Parameters vary; see the tool output in your AI assistant for the concrete structure.

</ParamField>

Typical workflow uses:

- Get an overview of the catalog before making changes.
- Narrow down to a subset of products to pass into follow-up tools.
- Build reports or summaries for specific product groups.

### woocommerce_get_product

Retrieve full details for a single product by identifier.

<ParamField body="product_id" param-type="string" required="true" show-location="false">

Unique product identifier as represented in your WooCommerce store. The assistant usually obtains this from `woocommerce_list_products` or another read tool.

</ParamField>

Use this when:

- You need the exact current state before editing.
- You want to summarize or rewrite descriptions for a specific product.
- You are about to duplicate or update a product and want to validate key fields.

### woocommerce_create_product

Create a new product in WooCommerce.

<ParamField body="product_data" param-type="object" required="true" show-location="false">

High-level product definition such as name, price, status, and other attributes. The supported fields mirror WooCommerce product fields; see the tool output in your AI assistant for the exact schema.

</ParamField>

Common workflows:

- Generate new products from a CSV, spreadsheet, or external catalog.
- Spin up draft products for campaign testing.
- Create localized versions of an existing product for a new market.

### woocommerce_update_product

Update an existing product.

<ParamField body="product_id" param-type="string" required="true" show-location="false">

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="updates" param-type="object" required="true" show-location="false">

<ParamField body="product_id" param-type="string" required="true" show-location="false">

Identifier of the product to duplicate.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="duplicate_options" param-type="object" show-location="false">

Optional flags controlling what to copy or adjust in the duplicate, such as status or visibility. Options vary; inspect the tool output in your AI assistant for details.

</ParamField>

Recommended patterns:

- Duplicate first, then update the copy rather than editing live products.
- Use duplicates as staging items for A/B tests.
- Keep original products intact for rollback and comparison.

### woocommerce_get_variations

List variations belonging to a variable product.

<ParamField body="product_id" param-type="string" required="true" show-location="false">

Identifier of the parent variable product.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="filters" param-type="object" show-location="false">

Optional filters such as status or specific attributes. Concrete fields depend on your WooCommerce configuration; see the tool output in your assistant.

## Safety and guardrails

WooCommerce tools can change live store data. Treat them with the same care you would give to direct database or dashboard changes.

Key practices:

- **Duplicate-first workflows**: For product changes, prefer `woocommerce_duplicate_product` followed by `woocommerce_update_product` on the copy instead of editing live items.
- **Confirmation prompts**: When you design prompts, ask the assistant to restate planned changes before applying them, especially for orders and inventory.
- **Read-only checks before writes**: Call list or get tools first to verify you are targeting the correct items, then apply updates.

For detailed guidance on store safety, guardrails, and audit logging, see the [WooCommerce safety notes](/woocommerce/safety).
