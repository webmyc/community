## What the add-on includes

The add-on exposes WooCommerce operations as safe MCP tools that follow the same "duplicate first, then edit" pattern you use for pages and posts.

### Products

Use AI to manage your product catalog without risking live listings.

- Create new simple and variable products from natural language prompts.
- Duplicate existing products before changing prices, descriptions, images, or attributes.
- Update variations, attributes, categories, and tags in bulk.
- Run batch operations across selected products (for example, adjust prices or toggle catalog visibility).

### Orders

Let AI help with day-to-day order handling while keeping core payment data safe.

- List and filter orders by status, customer, date range, or totals.
- Update order statuses to trigger standard WooCommerce email notifications.
- Edit billing and shipping addresses when customers send corrections.
- Generate summaries and reports from recent orders for quick overviews.

### Inventory

Keep stock levels in sync without manual spreadsheet work.

- Track stock per product and variation, including backorders.
- Identify low-stock or out-of-stock items based on your thresholds.
- Apply bulk quantity updates after a new shipment or stock take.
- Ask AI to flag anomalies, such as products that sell fast but sit at low stock.

### Reports and analytics

Turn store data into actionable insight.

- Generate sales reports by date range, product, category, or customer segment.
- Highlight top-selling products and slow movers.
- Calculate metrics like average order value and repeat purchase behavior.
- Export structured summaries you can move into spreadsheets or BI tools.

</Steps>

When you are ready for a full walkthrough with screenshots and validation steps, continue to the dedicated [WooCommerce installation guide](/woocommerce/installation).

## Quick start: prompt examples

Start with focused, low-risk prompts that update a small set of products or surface a batch of orders before you approve changes.

### Update a range of prices

```text
Find all WooCommerce products in the "Summer Collection" category with prices between €20 and €60.

Create duplicates and increase their prices by 10 percent, then show me a summary of the original vs new prices before applying changes.
```

### Process a batch of orders

```text
List all WooCommerce orders from the last 24 hours that are still "processing".

For each order:
- summarize the items and totals
- suggest if it is ready to mark as "completed"

Do not change any order until I explicitly confirm.
```

### Check inventory risk

```text
Review my WooCommerce inventory and list products with less than 5 units in stock in the last 7 days of sales data.

Group them by category, and suggest which ones I should restock first based on recent order volume.
```

Use these as templates and adjust categories, ranges, and thresholds to match your store.

## Safety features

WooCommerce Integration follows Respira's safety-first design so you can explore AI workflows without risking accidental store damage.

- **Duplicate-before-edit for products**: The add-on duplicates products before editing titles, descriptions, images, or pricing, so your original listings stay intact until you approve changes.
- **Scoped order handling**: Order tools focus on statuses, addresses, and summaries; sensitive areas stay read-only to keep financial and customer data protected.
- **Grace period on expiry**: If your subscription lapses, the add-on enters a grace period rather than stopping abruptly, giving you time to renew without losing access to existing configurations.

<Callout kind="tip">

The financial core of your store stays under WooCommerce and your payment gateway. Use AI to prepare, summarize, and stage changes, then confirm important updates (like live price changes) yourself.

## MCP tools reference

Behind the scenes, the add-on exposes WooCommerce-specific tools for products, orders, inventory, and reporting that your AI assistant calls on your behalf.

If you want to see the exact tool names, parameters, and response fields, open the [WooCommerce tools reference](/woocommerce/tools). That page covers:

- Product tools for reading, duplicating, and updating catalog items.
- Order tools for listing, filtering, and updating statuses.
- Inventory tools for stock levels and bulk updates.
- Reporting tools for summaries and exports.

Use the reference when you need precise control or are designing custom workflows.

## Common workflows

Here are patterns store owners and agencies use most often with the add-on.

### Seasonal price updates

Use AI to stage price changes across a collection, then approve the changes after review.

- Ask AI to find products in a specific category or tag.
- Have it duplicate those products with updated prices or sale flags.
- Review the diff and publish when you are satisfied.

### New collection launches

Turn a simple brief into a complete product lineup.

- Provide a description of the new collection, target audience, and price range.
- Let AI propose product names, short descriptions, long descriptions, and initial prices.
- Confirm which products to create in WooCommerce and which should stay as drafts.

### Inventory and purchasing checks

Align purchasing with current demand without opening spreadsheets.

- Ask AI to group low-stock products by vendor, category, or margin.
- Generate purchase suggestions with quantities and priority levels.
- Export the results or paste them into your purchasing system.

### Customer service support

Help your team answer "where is my order" and "can you change my address" requests faster.

- Have AI summarize recent orders for a given email or name.
- Ask it to verify whether an order can still ship with a corrected address.
- Let it propose a clear, friendly response you can paste into your help desk.

## Limitations

The add-on is designed for safe, high-leverage operations, not complete automation of your store.

- The add-on does not replace WooCommerce itself; it layers AI workflows on top of your existing store.
- Payment processing, refunds, and payout handling remain under WooCommerce and your payment providers.
- Some sensitive actions and configuration areas are intentionally read-only to reduce risk.
- Large bulk operations may be batched to respect performance and tool limits rather than running thousands of changes at once.

If you need a specific capability that is not available yet, reach out using the support details below.

## Troubleshooting and support

If something does not look right, start with the general [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) page, then move to the [WooCommerce troubleshooting guide](/woocommerce/troubleshooting) for store-specific checks.

Common issues you might see include:

- The add-on is not detected by Respira even though the plugin is active.
- License activation fails or shows as inactive after saving.
- Product duplicates do not appear when you expect them.
- WooCommerce tools do not show up in your AI tool list.

Support is included with your **€7/month** subscription.
