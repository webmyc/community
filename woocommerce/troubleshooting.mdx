description: Fix common WooCommerce add-on issues: tool detection, license activation, and product duplication problems.

## Quick diagnostics

Rule out common environment issues before you dive into a specific symptom.

- Confirm the WooCommerce add-on is installed and activated in WordPress.
- Verify your setup against [WooCommerce installation](/woocommerce/installation).
- Open the WooCommerce overview inside MCP to see which tools are currently available.

<Callout kind="tip">

If you changed plugins, themes, or hosting recently, note what changed. Most WooCommerce issues trace back to an environment change.

## Add-on not detected in MCP

MCP does not show any WooCommerce tools for your site.

### Symptoms

- MCP connects to your WordPress site but shows no WooCommerce tools.
- Woo-specific prompts or tools you expect from [WooCommerce tools](/woocommerce/tools) are missing.
- Requests that should touch products or orders return generic WordPress behavior instead.

### Likely causes

- The WooCommerce add-on license is not active for this site.
- The core WooCommerce plugin is not active in WordPress.
- The MCP server needs a restart to pick up the new tools.
- The site context prompt does not mention WooCommerce, so MCP stays in generic mode.

### Steps to fix

- In WordPress, go to **WP Admin → Respira → WooCommerce** and confirm the license shows as active.
- In **Plugins**, verify the core **WooCommerce** plugin is installed and activated.
- Restart MCP:
  - Stop the MCP server process.
  - Start it again and reconnect to the same WordPress site.
- Check your site context prompt:
  - Open your site configuration in MCP.
  - Make sure the context mentions that the site is a WooCommerce store and that you want WooCommerce tools available.

<Callout kind="info">

After restarting MCP and confirming the license and plugin status, you should see WooCommerce tools appear in your tools list. If they still do not show up, move to the **Before you contact support** checklist below.

## License activation failed

License activation fails or MCP reports an invalid license key.

### Symptoms

- The license field in **WP Admin → Respira → WooCommerce** shows an error after activation.
- MCP shows license or subscription errors when you try to use WooCommerce tools.
- Tools previously available are now disabled with a licensing message.

### Likely causes

- The full license key was not copied, or extra whitespace was included.
- The subscription is not active in LemonSqueezy.
- The site URL in WordPress does not match the site URL attached to the subscription.
- The license has been used on a different site than the one configured.

### Steps to fix

- Copy the license key again from your purchase email or LemonSqueezy, and paste it into the license field without spaces before or after it.
- Log into LemonSqueezy and confirm the WooCommerce add-on subscription is active.
- Compare the **WordPress Address (URL)** and **Site Address (URL)** in **Settings → General** with the site URL shown in your LemonSqueezy subscription.
- If the site URL changed (for example, from staging to production), update the URL in your subscription or deactivate the license on the old site.
- Try activating the license again in **WP Admin → Respira → WooCommerce**.

<Callout kind="alert">

If the license still fails to activate after these checks, capture a screenshot of the error and follow the **Before you contact support** checklist so Mihai can resolve it quickly.

## Products not duplicating

WooCommerce products are not being duplicated as expected.

### Symptoms

- A duplicate product request appears to succeed, but no new product shows in the Products list.
- Some products duplicate correctly, but others do not.
- You see permission or memory-related errors in your logs.

### Likely causes

- New products are created as drafts and hidden from the main Products list.
- The MCP or API user does not have permission to create WooCommerce products.
- The site hits PHP memory limits during product duplication.
- A plugin or custom code prevents programmatic product creation.

### Steps to fix

- Check **Products → Drafts** in WordPress for newly created products that do not appear in the main list.
- Confirm the user associated with MCP has permission to create and edit products in WooCommerce.
- Review your PHP memory limit in `wp-config.php` or hosting settings and increase it if it is low for your catalog size.
- Open your audit log or site logs to see whether product creation is blocked by another plugin or custom code.
- Temporarily disable non-essential WooCommerce extensions and retry a product duplication to see if one of them is interfering.

<Callout kind="tip">

If products start duplicating after you increase the PHP memory limit or disable a specific plugin, keep that change in place and re-enable other plugins one by one to confirm the root cause.

## WooCommerce tools missing or partially missing

Some WooCommerce tools appear, but others are missing or behave inconsistently.

### Symptoms

- Only a subset of expected WooCommerce tools shows up in MCP.
- Tools disappear after a plugin update or cache clear.
- A tool is visible but errors when you try to run it.

### Likely causes

- The WooCommerce add-on is outdated compared to your core plugin.
- Object caching still serves an older tools configuration.
- The add-on plugin needs a clean deactivate/reactivate cycle.
- Another plugin conflicts with specific WooCommerce tools.

### Steps to fix

- Update the WooCommerce add-on to the latest version from your plugin updates screen.
- Clear your object cache using your caching or hosting plugin, then refresh MCP.
- Deactivate and then reactivate the WooCommerce add-on in **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.
- Temporarily disable other plugins that interact heavily with WooCommerce (inventory, pricing, product builder) and see whether the missing tools reappear.
- Recheck the [WooCommerce overview](/woocommerce/overview) inside MCP to confirm the full tool set.

<Callout kind="info">

After updating and clearing cache, you should see a consistent set of WooCommerce tools across MCP and your WordPress site. If tools are still missing, collect logs and continue with the support checklist.
