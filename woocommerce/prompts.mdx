## How to use these WooCommerce prompts

Run these prompts in Claude Code, Cursor, or your preferred AI IDE with Respira connected to your WooCommerce store. Each prompt:

- States a **clear goal**
- Includes **safety guardrails** (confirmation, do-not-touch fields)
- Explains what **Respira will do** and what **you should review** before approving changes

For safety details and recommended workflow, read:

- [WooCommerce safety guide](/woocommerce/safety)
- [WooCommerce tools reference](/woocommerce/tools)

<Callout kind="info">

If you are ever unsure about a prompt or a change, email support at `word@respira.press` and reference the action you are trying to take.

## Bulk price updates by category

Update prices for many products in a controlled, review-first way.

### Goal

Apply a percentage discount to all products in one or more categories, with separate regular and sale prices and a confirmation step.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Apply a temporary percentage discount to all products in the following categories:
- Category names: "Summer Collection", "Swimwear"
- Discount: 20% off the current regular price
- Sale period: from today until 30 days from now

Safety rules:
- First, list the products you plan to change with:
  - product ID
  - product name
  - current regular price
  - proposed new regular price
  - proposed sale price
- DO NOT change:
  - product titles
  - product descriptions
  - product images
  - product categories or tags
  - stock status or stock quantities
- Only modify:
  - regular_price
  - sale_price
  - date_on_sale_from
  - date_on_sale_to

Workflow:
1. Use WooCommerce tools to:
   - find products in the categories above
   - calculate the new regular and sale prices (round to 2 decimals)
2. Present a summary table of all proposed changes and:
   - show the total number of products affected
   - show the min, max, and average current price vs new price
3. STOP and ask:
   "Do you confirm applying these price changes to these products? Reply YES to proceed or NO to cancel."

If I reply YES:
- Apply the updates in WooCommerce exactly as proposed.
- Then, generate a short change log summary I can save, including:
  - date/time
  - categories affected
  - number of products updated
  - discount percentage

If I reply anything else:
- Cancel the changes and clearly state that no product prices were updated.

Follow Respira’s safety-first workflow and double-check tool outputs before applying any bulk change.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Fetch products in the specified categories and calculate discounted regular and sale prices.
- Show you a preview list and aggregate stats, then wait for explicit `YES` before applying updates.
- Write price and sale date fields only, leaving content and inventory untouched.

**What you should review**

- Scan the preview list for any products that should be excluded (for example high-ticket items).
- Confirm the discount percentage and dates are correct before replying `YES`.
- After updates, spot-check a few products in your WooCommerce admin to verify prices and sale dates.

## Bulk price updates: safe vs aggressive modes

Choose between a conservative, double-confirmation update and a faster, higher-risk update. Start with safe unless you are fully confident in the scope.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Safe mode (recommended)" icon="shield">

**Goal**

Run a bulk price change with full previews, separate confirmation, and automatic duplicate backups for key products.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Perform a SAFE bulk price increase on selected products:
- Target: all products in categories "Electronics" and "Accessories"
- Increase: 10% on regular_price only
- No sale prices, no sale dates

Safety rules:
- Step 1: Identify target products and show:
  - product ID
  - product name
  - current regular price
  - proposed new regular price
- Step 2: For the 5 highest-priced products in this set:
  - create duplicates as backups before any price change
  - clearly label each duplicate as "Backup - DO NOT PUBLISH"
- Step 3: Present:
  - a preview table of ALL proposed price changes
  - a list of the 5 products that will get backup duplicates

Important:
- DO NOT modify:
  - product titles, descriptions, images
  - product categories or tags
  - stock quantities or stock status
  - sale_price or any sale date fields
- Only modify regular_price on the ORIGINAL products (not the backups).

Confirmation:
After showing the previews and backup list, STOP and ask:
"Do you confirm applying the new regular prices to these products (backups already created for the top 5)? Reply YES to proceed or NO to cancel."

If I reply YES:
- Apply the regular price changes to the original products only.
- Summarize what changed.

If I reply anything else:
- Cancel without changing any prices and confirm that nothing was updated.

Follow Respira’s safety guidelines and verify tool results at each step.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Find target products, calculate new prices, and create backup duplicates for the most valuable items.
- Show you all proposed changes and backup records, then wait for an explicit `YES`.
- Apply only regular price changes and leave backups untouched.

**What you should review**

- Confirm the product list and the top 5 highest-priced items look correct.
- Check that backups are correctly labeled as non-publishable or excluded from catalogs.
- Ensure no fields beyond `regular_price` are being modified.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Aggressive mode (fast)" icon="zap">

**Goal**

Apply a broad bulk price change after a single confirmation. Use only when you clearly understand the scope and have recent backups.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Apply an AGGRESSIVE bulk price change to a large set of products:
- Target: all products in category "Clearance"
- Change: set regular_price to match current sale_price (clear out sale prices)
- Then remove any sale prices so the new regular price becomes the only visible price.

Safety rules:
- First, list:
  - total number of products that currently have a sale_price in "Clearance"
  - a sample of 10 products with:
    - product ID
    - product name
    - current regular_price
    - current sale_price
    - proposed new regular_price (equal to current sale_price)
- DO NOT modify:
  - product titles, descriptions, images
  - product categories or tags
  - stock quantities or stock status
- Only modify:
  - regular_price (set to current sale_price)
  - sale_price (set to empty/null)
  - sale dates (cleared)

Confirmation:
After the sample preview, STOP and ask:
"This is an AGGRESSIVE update affecting all Clearance products with a sale price.
New regular_price will be set to the current sale_price, and sale_price will be cleared.
Reply CONFIRM to proceed, or anything else to cancel."

If I reply CONFIRM:
- Apply the updates to all matching products.
- Report:
  - total number of products updated
  - total value of price changes (sum of old regular_price minus new regular_price).

If I reply anything else:
- Cancel and clearly state that no prices were changed.

Always respect Respira’s safety requirements and clearly log what changed.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Identify all clearance products with a sale price and propose collapsing sale prices into regular prices.
- Apply updates to the entire matching set after a single `CONFIRM`.
- Clear sale prices and dates entirely.

**What you should review**

- Ensure you really want sale prices turned into permanent regular prices across all clearance items.
- Consider taking a manual database or store backup before confirming.
- After running, verify a few products to confirm that sale badges and sale dates are gone.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Create new products from a template

Generate consistent products from a base template while protecting existing items.

### Goal

Use an existing product as a template to create several new products with consistent structure and safe constraints.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Create new products based on a template product while keeping the original unchanged.

Template:
- Use the product with ID 8123 as the template.
- Copy its:
  - product type (simple vs variable)
  - tax class
  - shipping class
  - attributes structure
  - SEO/meta fields

New products to create (simple examples):
1) "Organic Cotton Tee - Navy"
   - slug: "organic-cotton-tee-navy"
   - price: 29.00
   - category: "Apparel"
   - tags: ["Organic", "T-Shirt"]
   - stock status: "instock"
2) "Organic Cotton Tee - Olive"
   - slug: "organic-cotton-tee-olive"
   - price: 29.00
   - category: "Apparel"
   - tags: ["Organic", "T-Shirt"]
   - stock status: "instock"

Safety rules:
- DO NOT modify the template product in any way.
- DO NOT change any existing products.
- Only create new products based on the template.
- For each new product:
  - adjust title, slug, category, tags, and price as specified
  - keep template tax/shipping/meta configuration
- Set new products to "draft" status so I can review before publishing.

Workflow:
1. Read the template product and summarize the important fields you will reuse.
2. Show a structured plan for each new product, including:
   - title
   - slug
   - price
   - stock status
   - categories
   - tags
   - any inherited attributes/meta
3. STOP and ask:
   "Do you approve creating these new DRAFT products based on template 8123? Reply YES to create or NO to cancel."

If I reply YES:
- Create the new products as drafts.
- Return a list with:
  - new product IDs
  - titles
  - permalinks.

If I reply anything else:
- Do not create anything and confirm that no products were added.

Follow Respira’s safety-first process and keep a clear audit trail of which products were created.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Inspect the template product, propose new product definitions, and wait for confirmation.
- Create new draft products that copy configuration but customize title, slug, categories, tags, and price.
- Leave the template and any existing products untouched.

**What you should review**

- Confirm the field mapping for each new product (categories, tags, price, attributes).
- Make sure everything is in `draft` status before publishing in WooCommerce.
- Check URLs and SEO/meta fields on a few new products before bulk publishing.

## Order fulfillment by region

Move digital-only orders to completed after checking items and region rules.

### Goal

Mark qualifying orders as completed once digital items are delivered, without touching physical shipments or triggering unexpected emails outside the rules you set.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Identify digital-only orders from the last 7 days for a specific region and safely move them from "processing" to "completed" once they meet the criteria.

Target:
- Order status: "processing"
- Order type: digital-only (no physical/shippable items)
- Region: shipping country is "United States"
- Time window: created within the last 7 days

Safety rules:
- DO NOT change:
  - order totals, taxes, or discounts
  - line items or quantities
  - customer email addresses
- Only modify:
  - order_status (from "processing" to "completed")
- Before updating any order:
  - confirm that all items are digital/downloadable
  - ensure there is no shipment tracking or shipping label attached
- Respect WooCommerce’s normal email behavior:
  - clearly state whether completing these orders will trigger completion emails.

Workflow:
1. List candidate orders with:
   - order ID
   - customer name
   - country
   - current status
   - digital-only confirmation (yes/no)
2. From that list, select only the orders that are:
   - in the United States
   - digital-only
   - created in the last 7 days
3. Present a final list of orders you propose to mark as completed.

STOP and ask:
"Do you confirm updating these orders from 'processing' to 'completed'? Reply YES to proceed or NO to cancel."

If I reply YES:
- Update only those orders’ statuses to "completed".
- Summarize:
  - how many orders were changed
  - their IDs
  - any emails WooCommerce reports as sent.

If I reply anything else:
- Do not change any order statuses and clearly confirm that nothing was updated.

Use Respira’s safety guardrails and treat any order update as irreversible without backups.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Fetch processing orders, filter to digital-only, United States, last 7 days.
- Propose a list of order IDs to complete and explain any email side effects.
- Update only status fields after your explicit `YES`.

**What you should review**

- Check that no physical or mixed orders appear in the final list.
- Confirm the time window and region match your expectations.
- Consider testing on a small subset first, then expanding the criteria in a follow-up prompt.

## Inventory management for variable products

Audit and adjust stock per variation, focusing on low-stock notifications.

### Goal

Identify low-stock variations within variable products and optionally adjust stock levels for a specific threshold.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Review inventory for VARIABLE products and highlight low-stock variations, then optionally top them up after I confirm.

Scope:
- Include only variable products.
- Focus on their variations (size/color/etc.).
- Low-stock threshold: less than or equal to 5 units in stock.
- Time filter: variations that had at least 1 order in the last 60 days.

Safety rules:
- DO NOT change:
  - product titles, descriptions, images
  - prices or taxes
- Only modify (after explicit confirmation):
  - stock_quantity for individual variations
  - stock_status (if needed, e.g. from "outofstock" to "instock" when quantity > 0)

Workflow:
1. List all matching low-stock variations with:
   - parent product ID and title
   - variation ID
   - variation attributes (e.g. size/color)
   - current stock_quantity
   - stock_status
   - number of orders in the last 60 days
2. Propose a replenishment plan, for example:
   - set stock_quantity to 20 for variations that sold > 5 units in the last 60 days
   - set stock_quantity to 10 for variations that sold 1–5 units
   - leave zero-order variations unchanged
3. Present the proposed changes as a table and clearly separate:
   - variations to UPDATE (with old vs new stock_quantity)
   - variations to LEAVE AS IS

STOP and ask:
"Do you approve applying these stock updates to the listed variations only? Reply YES to update or NO to cancel."

If I reply YES:
- Apply the stock updates exactly as proposed.
- Summarize:
  - how many variations were updated
  - total stock added.

If I reply anything else:
- Do not change any stock values and confirm that inventory was not modified.

Follow Respira’s safety approach and avoid broad, unfiltered inventory edits.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Pull variable products and their variations, filter by sales history and low stock.
- Propose a targeted replenishment plan and wait for your approval.
- Update `stock_quantity` and `stock_status` only for the confirmed variations.

**What you should review**

- Ensure the low-stock threshold and lookback window (60 days) match your needs.
- Check that the proposed new quantities align with your purchasing and warehousing constraints.
- Spot-check some parent products in WooCommerce to confirm variation stock looks correct.

## Low-stock check for all products

Quickly scan your catalog for items that need attention without making changes.

### Goal

Generate a low-stock report that you can act on manually or with a separate replenishment prompt.

```text
You are connected to my WooCommerce store through Respira.

Goal:
Produce a low-stock report across my entire catalog without changing anything.

Scope:
- Include simple and variable products.
- For variable products, report at the variation level.
- Low-stock threshold: 3 units or fewer.
- Exclude products in category "Discontinued".

Safety rules:
- READ-ONLY: Do not modify any products or stock values.
- Do not change stock_status, stock_quantity, prices, or any other fields.

Workflow:
1. List low-stock items with:
   - product ID (and variation ID if applicable)
   - product/variation title
   - SKU
   - current stock_quantity
   - stock_status
   - category names
2. Group results by category and show:
   - number of low-stock items per category
3. Provide:
   - a CSV-style table in the response that I can export
   - a short summary of the top 10 most urgent items.

Confirm at the end that:
- no products were updated
- this was a read-only inventory check.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Scan products and variations, filter to low stock, and organize results by category.
- Return a structured, exportable report with no write operations.
- Clearly confirm that no data was changed.

**What you should review**

- Verify the threshold (3 units) and excluded categories.
- Use the CSV-style result as input for a follow-up replenishment prompt or manual stock update.
- Consider adjusting the threshold and rerunning during peak seasons.

- Include:
  - total gross sales
  - total net sales
  - total number of orders
  - average order value
  - top 20 products by revenue
  - top 10 categories by revenue

Safety rules:

   - total completed/processing orders
   - average order value
2. List top 20 products by revenue with:
   - product ID
   - product name
   - quantity sold
   - gross revenue
   - refunds (if available)
3. List top 10 categories by revenue with:
   - category name
   - total revenue
   - number of orders containing that category
4. Provide a short narrative summary in plain language that highlights:
   - which products are driving most revenue
   - any categories that are underperforming.

At the end, explicitly state:
- that this was a read-only analysis
- that no orders or products were changed.
```

**What Respira will do**

- Read order and product data for the last 30 days and compute key metrics.
- Build ranked lists of top products and categories.
- Return both structured tables and a plain-language commentary.

**What you should review**

- Confirm the date range and order statuses reflect your reporting conventions.
- Validate totals against your existing WooCommerce reports for sanity.
- Use underperforming categories as prompts for follow-up actions (content refresh, pricing review, or promotions).

## Safety reminders and support

<Callout kind="tip">

Start with smaller scopes (single category, shorter time window, or limited sample size) before running wide-ranging updates. Once you are confident the pattern is correct, expand the scope in a new prompt.

</Callout>

<Callout kind="alert">

If you suspect any unexpected behavior, stop running write prompts and contact support at `word@respira.press`. Include the prompt you used and a description of what you expected vs what happened.
