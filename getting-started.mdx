description: Choose your Respira workflow and get running fast with Browser AI or Desktop AI, both powered by the same 88 tools.

## Welcome

Respira gives you two equally valid workflows:

- **Browser AI** (WebMCP built-in, fast setup)
- **Desktop AI** (MCP server, advanced workflows)

Both modes use the same 88 tools and the same duplicate-before-edit safety workflow.

## Choose your path

### Path A: Browser AI (fastest)

Best for quick edits, content updates, and team collaboration.

1. Install and activate Respira plugin
2. Open your browser AI client in Chrome 146+
3. Start with a simple request

Continue with: [Browser AI Setup](/browser-ai)

### Path B: Desktop AI (power workflows)

Best for automation, batch operations, and terminal/editor-centric workflows.

1. Install and activate Respira plugin
2. Generate API key in WordPress admin
3. Run MCP setup wizard
4. Connect Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf

Continue with: [Desktop AI (MCP Server)](/mcp-server)
