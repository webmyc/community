# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

**Give more than you receive.**

If you get help, help someone else. If you learn something, document it. If you solve a problem, share the solution.

This community works because people contribute more than they extract.

**Socrates' Triple Filter**

Before posting, ask yourself:

1. **Is it true?** Have you verified what you're sharing? Are your reproduction steps accurate?
2. **Is it kind?** Would you want to receive this comment if you were the author?
3. **Is it useful?** Does this move the conversation forward, help someone, or add value?

If your post fails all three filters, reconsider.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness
* Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing when we make mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* **Sharing solutions, not just problems**
* **Documenting workarounds so others can find them**
* **Redacting secrets and private data before posting**

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Posting secrets, API keys, license keys, or client data
* Demanding immediate responses or priority support
* "It doesn't work" without details, steps, or context
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate
