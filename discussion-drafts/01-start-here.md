Welcome to the **Respira for WordPress GitHub Community**.

This is the public community hub on GitHub: docs, discussions, wiki, and prompt recipes.
It does not contain the commercial plugin source code.

## What Respira is

- A duplicate-first workflow for safe edits in WordPress
- A copilot for common site operations and builder workflows
- A place to share prompt recipes that actually work

## What Respira is not

- Not "AI magically fixes everything"
- Not a substitute for staging, backups, or basic caution
- Not a place to paste secrets, keys, or client data
