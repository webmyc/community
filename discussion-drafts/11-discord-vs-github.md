The **Respira for WordPress GitHub Community** has GitHub Discussions (here) and Discord (link below).

**Use GitHub for:**
- Bug reports → searchable forever
- Feature requests → trackable, votable
- Docs questions → findable via search
- Troubleshooting → helps future people
- Prompt recipes → needs cataloguing

**Use Discord for:**
- Quick questions
- Real-time help
- Community chat
- Voice/screenshare debugging
- Off-topic conversation

**The rule:** If the answer should be discoverable in 6 months → post here on GitHub.

**Discord invite:** [Join Respira Discord](https://go.respira.cafe/respira-discord)

When you get a great answer in Discord, post a summary here so it's searchable.
