The **Respira for WordPress GitHub Community** Wiki is now open for contributions.

## What is it?

A community-maintained knowledge base for:
- Tested prompt recipes (copy-paste and adapt)
- Troubleshooting patterns (common issues + fixes)
- Integration guides (MCP orchestration)
- Builder-specific tips (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg)
- Real-world case studies

## Wiki vs Discussions

**Wiki** = curated, permanent, searchable. Things that should be findable in 6 months.
**Discussions** = questions, support, conversation. Things that need a reply.

## How to contribute

1. Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/webmyc/community/wiki)
2. Find a page that needs improvement (or create one)
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Save with an edit summary

**Guidelines:** Test before posting. Redact secrets. Use the [templates](https://github.com/webmyc/community/wiki/Contributing-to-Wiki).
