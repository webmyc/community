title: "Community Philosophy: Give More Than You Receive"
category: "Community Meta"
---

This community works because people contribute more than they extract.

**How to give more:**

**If you ask a question and get an answer:**
→ Document the solution in a follow-up comment
→ Update the discussion with "Solved: here's what worked"
→ Help the next person who has the same problem

**If you solve a problem:**
→ Share the prompt that worked
→ Share the workaround you found
→ Share the docs you wish existed

**If you learn something:**
→ Turn it into a prompt recipe
→ Add it to troubleshooting discussions
→ Write a showcase post

**If you build something cool:**
→ Share screenshots (redacted)
→ Share the workflow
→ Share lessons learned

**The loop:**
You receive help → You give help → Someone else receives → They give → Repeat

This is how good communities stay good.
