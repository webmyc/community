This is the fastest path to success:

1) Duplicate the thing you want to edit (page, template, layout)
2) Make the change on the duplicate
3) Verify on staging (or at least in a preview)
4) Publish only when it looks right

Common mistakes:

- editing live without a rollback path
- mixing multiple changes in one go
- not capturing the "before" state
