Here are reusable patterns that keep you out of trouble.

## Pattern 1: Duplicate-first edit

Ask for a plan, then execute in a copy, then verify.

## Pattern 2: One change per run

Do not batch 12 edits. You will not know what broke.

## Pattern 3: Verification checklist

Desktop, mobile, key pages, forms, analytics, SEO basics.
