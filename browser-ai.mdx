## Browser AI in 60 seconds

Respira includes WebMCP directly in the plugin. You do not need a separate bridge plugin.

### Requirements

- WordPress admin access
- Respira for WordPress plugin
- Chrome 146+ browser
- Claude or Gemini account (or another browser AI client that supports WebMCP)

## Step 1: Install Respira

1. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New**
2. Search for **Respira for WordPress**
3. Click **Install**, then **Activate**

## Step 2: Open your browser AI client

Open your browser AI workflow in Chrome 146+ and connect it to your WordPress site through Respira.

WebMCP is built-in, so this setup is typically faster than desktop MCP setup.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Verify the connection

Try one quick request:

- "List pages on my WordPress site"
- "Analyze SEO for my homepage"
- "Create a duplicate of page 123"

If you get results, Browser AI is ready.

## What you can do

Browser AI has access to the same toolset as desktop mode:

- 88 tools total
- 77 WordPress tools
- 11 WooCommerce tools (with WooCommerce add-on)
- Same duplicate-before-edit safety workflow

## Browser AI vs Desktop AI

- Browser AI: fastest setup, ideal for quick edits and team workflows
- Desktop AI: ideal for advanced automation and scriptable workflows

You can use both modes at the same time.
